# MangaFox Downloader # 
My version of MangaFoxDownloader  
the original program is here: https://github.com/techwizrd/MangaFox-Download-Script  
all credit goes to this guy  

I made this for myself because the original wouldn't work  
if you are having the same problem this one works already  

Usage:  
  
```mfdl.py -m mangaName -s firstChapter -e lastChapter  ```  
  
for more info go to the original page  
will update soon probably
